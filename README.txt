This is AttendEase, an attendance keeping program designed for groups of any
size. It contains a simple point-and-click interface that allows for any
teacher or sponsor to quickly set up meetings and edit the students in a group.
There is also a system that allows for the tracking of points attained by
students for attending meetings and even keeps students with not enough points
from receiving the points from attending any subsequent meetings. 

One of the more convenient features is the ability to import students via a .xls
or .xlsx Excel file. Examples of these two file types are found in the same
location as this README, most likely "C:\Users\{YOUR_USER_NAME}\Documents\AttendEase".
